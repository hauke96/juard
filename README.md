A tiny little framework as a guard to good code quality and annoying programming.
# What is it?
A veeeery simple framework for contracts, events, dependency injection and logging in java.

It was originally developed for the [METRO project](https://github.com/hauke96/METRO/), but I need this also in some other projects, so I made a library out of it.

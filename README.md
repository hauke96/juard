# juard
A mixture between "Java" and "guard". Juard.
# What is it?
A veeeery simple framework for contracts in java. It actually just provides some if-clauses and some exceptions.

It was originally developed for the [METRO project](https://github.com/hauke96/METRO/), but I need this also in some other projects, so I made a library out of it.
